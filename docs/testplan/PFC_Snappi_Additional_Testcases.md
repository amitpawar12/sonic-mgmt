### Background

Intent of these testcases is to test throughput at the interface speed, PFC, PFC-WD, ECN congestion, port-channels and MACSEC. These testcases will be executed for 100 and 400Gbps ports on single line-card single asic, single line-card multiple asic and multiple line-card. The packet-size will vary from 128 to 1400 bytes.

Test cases are specifically meant for Multi-ASIC, DNX based chassis platform.

Traffic pattern includes at least one lossless priority flow and with/without lossy background traffic. Some of the testcases use pause flows to simulate congestion.

Additionally, the testcases also intend to capture the utilization, packet-drops and/or latency.
